Tool to configure Postgres logical objects, being Users, Roles, Databases and Extensions.

The provided Makefile takes care of most docker/gcloud stuff.

## Requirements

### PGCDFGA config

PGCDFGA can be configured using a configuration yaml.
In container deployments (like Kubernetes), that might be configmap mounted as a volume.

### Postgres User account

The PGCDFGA tool requires a postgres user with access and SUPERUSER privilleges to run.
The user could be made available either with:
- Local access (when running inside of master container) and using ident (or trust) authentication
- A username / password configured with setup.sql script (and setting PG_PRIMARY_USER, PG_PRIMARY_PASSWORD, etc.).
- A client certificate (by far the most secure solution)

The most convenient way is to use a client certificate, handed out to PGCDFGA user as configured in config.yaml (postgres.dsn).

## Make

## Make build

Will build the docker image from `Dockerfile`, using variables in `Dockerfile` to determine image name, version and project.

```
make build
```

### Make tag

Will tag images for usage with `gcloud`, using variables in `Dockerfile` to determine image name, version and project.

Will tag both latest and version.

```
make tag
```

### Make push

Will push latest and versioned images to gcloud, using variables in `Dockerfile` to determine image name and version.

```
make push
```

By default it will try to push to dockerhub.com/bol.com/pgcdfga. To override that, set the environmentvariable to the other projectname.

For example:
```
export PROJECTS=eu.gcr.io/my-cool-app-tst-proj eu.gcr.io/my-cool-app-pro-proj
make push
```
will push to the following projects:
* eu.gcr.io/my-cool-app-tst-proj/pgcdfga
* eu.gcr.io/my-cool-app-pro-proj/pgcdfga

### Make run

Runs the built image, using variables in Dockerfile to determine image name, version and project. Using the `--rm` flag to keep the system clean.

```
make run
```

### Make all

Will use build and tag as described above. Pushing is not included (yet)

```
make
```

## Example:
* First build the container image:
```
make
```
* Request server certificates, generate client cerificates and configure the Postgres database server accordingly
* Store serverca cert in `testdata/sererca.pem`
* Store client cert in `testdata/client_pgcdfga_chain.pem` and key in `testdata/client_pgcdfga.key` (in Kubernetes this will be secrets mounted as a volume)
* store ldap user / password in seperate files (in kubernetes this will be secrets mounted as a volume)
* configure `testdata/config.yaml` correctly (e.a. hostname, location of ldap user/pw files, etc.)
* start the container
```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/pgcdfga_config pgcdfga
```

# Developing
This tool was initially developed in-house by [bol.com](https://www.bol.com) and then open sourced.

## New minor release:
The very latest and greatest is always in master. So if we are working on 0.9.3, everything up until 0.9.2 is tagged. To tag 0.9.3, do the following:
* First run `make clean` (you will raise the version in `Dockerfile` after which `make clean` does not clean older versions)
* Freeze the current minor release by tagging it (on bol.com's internal gitlab, click `new tag`)
 * Also add a list of all patches of this minor release to the changelog
 * use `git log` if commit messages are properly formatted
 * use `git show` for a certain commit if you are unsure of one
 * use `git diff` if you are unsure of al (e.a. `git diff 0.9.2`)
* Finish by commiting the version change
 * Change the version of the package, which is listed in `pgcdfga/__init__.py` to reflect the new release
 * Use 'Raising version to [new_version]' for the commit message
 * This will be the first commit after freezing the previous version

Note: Up until 0.9.3 this procedure was not always followed thoroughly enough...

## New major release:
The very latest and greatest is always in master. So if we are currently working on major 0.9, every major up until 0.8 is a branch.
To start developing 1.0, you should create a 0.9 branch that points to the latest of 0.9 development, and after that change version info in master.
* First run `make clean` (you will raise the version in `Dockerfile` after which `make clean` does not clean older versions)
* Create a new branch from master
* Finish by commiting the version change
 * Change the version of the package, which is listed in `pgcdfga/__init__.py` to reflect the new release
 * Use 'Raising version to [new_version]' for the commit message
 * Commit this version change as a first commit in the new branch (using merge requests)
